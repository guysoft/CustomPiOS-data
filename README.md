# CustomPiOS-data
This is the data repo for CustomPiOS](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS/) to hold image and board configurations and possibly more later on.
If you want to add an image or a board to build on you can PR to this repo.

CustomPiOS is a `Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ and other ARM devices distribution builder. CustomPiOS opens an already existing image, modifies it and repackages the image ready to ship.

## Donate
CustomPiOS is 100% free and open source and maintained by Guy Sheffer. If its helping your life, your organisation or makes you happy, please consider making a donation. It means I can code more and worry less about my balance. Any amount counts.
Also many thanks to people contributing code.
